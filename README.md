# Mechanism-Design-4-Bar-6-Bar-Linkages
Here’s a quick summary of synthesis approaches in mechanism design:

1. Path Generation

• Objective: Move a point (e.g., coupler or tracer point) through specific positions (waypoints) in space.
• Focus: Point’s trajectory, not orientation.
• Example: Tracing a curve or path. (we just need the coupler or tracer in 6-bar linkages to trace/track the desired path in spatial domian). 

2. Motion Generation (Body Guidance)
• Objective: Move a rigid body through specified positions and orientations.
• Focus: Both position and angular orientation of a body.
• Example: Robotic arm following poses.

3. Function Generation
• Objective: Achieve a specific input-output relationship between two links.
• Focus: Mechanism as a function generator (e.g., θ_in → θ_out).
• Example: Engine valve mechanism.
(in Robotics we have: Path Planning (designing the waypoints only spatial domain as there is no time requirements) and Trajectory Planning (waypoints with corresponding time vector as constraint)).

Synthesis Methods:

• Analytical (Geometric): Closed-form solutions using geometry, loop equations.

• Graphical: Manual drawing-based design (classical method).

• Numerical (Optimization-based): Use techniques like GA or PSO to meet desired performance under constraints.

In general for a Mechanism project follow the following stpes in general:
0- You hould have the desired path .... to trace 
1- Synthesis (is the process of designing the Geometry of a mechanism to achieve a specific task, like generating a desired motion or path using methods like graphical, analytical, or numerical approaches, which includes path or waypints generation)  
2- Modeling (also include the Jaboian like: Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics) and derive all dynamic (kinetics and kinematics) equations using Lagrangian or Newtonians 
3- Control: implement a controller to make the motions 

Both 4-bar linkage and 6-bar linkage are 1-DOF systems. 
In geenral, you need to define the functionality (like: desired path to trace), based on this you choose the synthesis approach (path gen., function gen. or motion gen.); then use a method to synthesize (e.g., GA); but GA also requires to evaluate the function which requires FK or IK as the function to be evaluated in GA to find the optimal L1, L2, L3, L4 and theta of tracer (coupler). Next step would be: Controller design. We have already integrated / consolidated kinetics/kinematics which deriving the equations in GA step.
