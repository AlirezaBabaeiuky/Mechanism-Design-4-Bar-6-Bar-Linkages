# Mechanism-Design-4-Bar-6-Bar-Linkages
Here’s a quick summary of synthesis approaches in mechanism design:
⸻
1. Path Generation
• Objective: Move a point (e.g., coupler point) through specific positions in space.
• Focus: Point’s trajectory, not orientation.
• Example: Tracing a curve or path.
2. Motion Generation (Body Guidance)
• Objective: Move a rigid body through specified positions and orientations.
• Focus: Both position and angular orientation of a body.
• Example: Robotic arm following poses.
3. Function Generation
• Objective: Achieve a specific input-output relationship between two links.
• Focus: Mechanism as a function generator (e.g., θ_in → θ_out).
• Example: Engine valve mechanism.

Synthesis Methods:
• Analytical (Geometric): Closed-form solutions using geometry, loop equations.
• Graphical: Manual drawing-based design (classical method).
• Numerical (Optimization-based): Use techniques like GA or PSO to meet desired performance under constraints.
