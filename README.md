# Mechanism-Design-4-Bar-6-Bar-Linkages
Here’s a quick summary of synthesis approaches in mechanism design:

1. Path Generation

• Objective: Move a point (e.g., coupler or tracer point) through specific positions (waypoints) in space.
• Focus: Point’s trajectory, not orientation.
• Example: Tracing a curve or path. (we just need the coupler or tracer in 6-bar linkages to trace/track the desired path in spatial domian). 
2. Motion Generation (Body Guidance)
• Objective: Move a rigid body through specified positions and orientations.
• Focus: Both position and angular orientation of a body.
• Example: Robotic arm following poses.
3. Function Generation
• Objective: Achieve a specific input-output relationship between two links.
• Focus: Mechanism as a function generator (e.g., θ_in → θ_out).
• Example: Engine valve mechanism.
(in Robotics we have: Path Planning (designing the waypoints only spatial domain as there is no time requirements) and Trajectory Planning (waypoints with corresponding time vector as constraint)).

Synthesis Methods:

• Analytical (Geometric): Closed-form solutions using geometry, loop equations.

• Graphical: Manual drawing-based design (classical method).

• Numerical (Optimization-based): Use techniques like GA or PSO to meet desired performance under constraints.

In general for a Mechanism project follow the following stpes in general:
1- Synthesis (is the process of designing the Geometry of a mechanism to achieve a specific task, like generating a desired motion or path using methods like graphical, analytical, or numerical approaches, which includes path or waypints generation)  
2- Modeling (also include the Jaboian like: Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics) and derive all dynamic (kinetics and kinematics) equations using Lagrangian or Newtonians 
3- Control: implement a controller to make the motions
